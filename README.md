# Inertia Wheel Pendulum
## MECA 482-02 Group 5: *Victor Alvarez, Xavier Andrade, Sean Murray, Samuel Kelly, John Voter*

## Introduction
**1. Background**

The inertia wheel pendulum is a system that seeks to stabilize a pendulum in the inverted upright position. This is to be acheived by calculated accelleration of an inertia wheel at the end of the pendulum arm. In order to achieve the desired functionality, one end of the pendulum arm is attached to a rotating base that is fixed to a table-end. An encoder serves as the rotating base in order to track the pendulum arm's angle of rotation. Figure 1 below captures the functional viewpoint for the system described above.

The purpose of this project is to design, build and test a system that meets the desired functional requirements. The following report serves as documentation as to how the final solution wat acheived by the team.
