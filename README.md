## Introduction
1. **Background**

The Inertia Wheel Pendulum is a system that seeks to stabilize a pendulum in the inverted upright position. This is to be acheived by calculated accelleration of an inertia wheel at the end of the pendulum arm. The system consists of a pendulum arm with one end fixed to a table top with the other arm-end is attached to a motor fixed to the inertia wheel. An encoder is integrated with the fixed end of the arm to track is angle of rotation.

The purpose of this project is to design, build and test a system that meets the desired functional requirements. The following report serves as documentation as to how the final solution wat acheived by the team. Listed below are several key resources utilized by the team throughout the control system desing process:
