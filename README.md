## Introduction
**1. Background**

The inertia wheel pendulum is a system that seeks to stabilize a pendulum in the inverted upright position. This is to be acheived by calculated accelleration of an inertia wheel at the end of the pendulum arm. In order to achieve the desired functionality, one end of the pendulum arm is attached to a rotating base that is fixed to a table-end. Incorporated into the system are two encoders, one serves as the rotating base in order to track the pendulum arm's angle of rotation while the other monitors wheel speed/position. Figure 1 below captures the operational viewpoint for the system described above.

The given operational viepoint serves to give the reader a very top-level vizualization of the physical system. However, it is unclear as to how this system will acheive the desired functionality. In response, a logical/functional viewpoint was created to serve as a reference for how components within the system interact with onanother. Seen below in Figure 2 is the logical/functional viepoint for the inertia wheel pendulum.

When couple with Figure 1, the logical/functional viewpoint serves to provide a complete top-level unserstanding of system functionality.

The following report consists of documentation pertaining to the solution obtained by the team. In order to acheive the desired functionality a mathematic model wast obtained for the system, from there a controller architechture was devised to simulate and implement the derived mathematical model. The following report consists of documentation of the control system design process.

## Modeling
**1. Schematic**

In order to derive the mathematical model for the inertia wheel pendulum, a schematic must first be constructed to define reference axes and system variables. Figure 3 below depicts the system schematic used to define relevant variables.

**1. Equation of Motion

For mechanical systems, a classical method to derive the equations of motion is the Euler-Lagrange approach. As is well known, this approach requires the computation of kinetic and potential energies and the subsequent knowledge of the forces acting on the system. The equations shown below represent the Euler-Lagrange equation with both interacting bodies.

In Eq.(1), the zero on the right hand side indicates that no external torque is being applied to the pendulum. The zero on the on Eq.(1) , indicates that no external torque is applied at the point where the pendulum hangs up since no potential force is being applied to the pendulum.

From here, the next step is to define the Lagrangian term depicted in the two equations above. The three equations below are general equations for: Lagrange, kinetic, and potential energies of a system.

The pendulum arm is a body with a mass distributed along its length, its kinetic energy is computed by adding the kinetic energy of a particle of mass <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, which translates on a circumference with radius <i>l</i><sub>c</sub> and the kinetic energy of a stick that rotates around its center of mass. Kinetic energy can be taken into account that the wheel‚Äôs angular velocity, as measured by an observer fixed to the  table, is ùù∑1+ ùù∑1.
